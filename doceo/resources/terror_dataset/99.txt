Iraq: 31, including 28 ISIL militants killed
BAGHDAD, Iraq - At least 31 people, including 28 Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant militants were killed in four separate incidents across Iraq Wednesday, security sources said. 
In the first incident, Iraqi air force killed eight ISIL militants in northeastern Iraq’s Diyala governorate, a security source said. 
The casualties took place when Iraqi air forces bombed an alleged ISIL base in Meqdadiya area in Diyala’s Ba’Qubah city. 
An ammunition depot was also destroyed in the airstrikes. 
Also, the Iraqi army backed by tribal fighters launched a ground offensive to coincide with the airstrikes during which they captured two ISIL militants, the same source added. 
Also Wednesday, the ISIL terrorist group attacked the al-Habaniya Iraqi military base located 18.6 miles (30 kilometers) east of Ramadi city in western Iraq’s Anbar governorate. 
Iraqi air forces repelled the attack during which around 20 ISIL militants were killed and three ISIL vehicles were destroyed, a security source said. This was the first time the ISIL had attacked the al-Habaniya base. 
Also, two people, including a soldier were killed and more than a dozen were wounded in three different improvised explosive device explosions across Baghdad city, police sources said. 
A tribe leader was also kidnapped in al-Tarmiya area in northern Baghdad. 
“Unknown assailants broke into the house of Sheikh Adnan, the leader of al-Salman tribe. 
The leader was kidnapped after assailants killed his brother,” police added. 
Iraq has been gripped by a security vacuum since June, when the ISIL group stormed the northern province of Mosul and declared what it called a caliphate in Iraq and Syria.
